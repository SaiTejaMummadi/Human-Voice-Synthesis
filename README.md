# Human-Voice-Synthesis
Software to convert speech to text using Python
Natural Language Processing technology is one from the fast-growing engineering technologies.It has a number of applications in different areas and provides potential benefits. Nearly 20% people of the world are suffering from various disabilities, many of them are blind or unable to use their hands effectively. The speech recognition systems in those particular cases provide a significant help to them, so that they can share information with people by operating computer through voice input. This project is designed and developed keeping that factor into mind, and a little effort is made to achieve this aim. Our project is capable to recognize the human speech and convert the input audio into text.
